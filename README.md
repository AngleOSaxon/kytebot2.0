# kytebot2.0
A second iteration of our beloved kytebot.

What began as an experiment with Threads and IRC RFCs has evolved into an ongoing experiment with Refactoring,
Patterns, and Deployments.

The result is a Java IRC bot framework that is used on irc.coldfront.net. There aren't many features as of yet,
but the feature backlog is very real and very long.

### Feature Backlog
- ability for trusted users to send messages to many channels at once
- Add command pipes which fit into command pipelines
- Pipelines for channel creation
- Perhaps spin off smaller Petbots...
